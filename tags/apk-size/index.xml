      <description>When I joined Monzo I was keen to keep a track of metrics that would help us keep a handle on the app&amp;rsquo;s size and method count. I set up a shell script on our CI to upload the numbers to StatHat each time we merged a change to our develop branch. This was great in theory, but not visible enough to be actually useful - in fact, one of the stats stopped uploading properly some months ago and we didn&amp;rsquo;t even notice.</description>
