      <description>A couple of weeks ago, I tweeted a survey to find out more about how Android developers were modularising their apps. It&amp;rsquo;s a broad and complicated topic, with no clear standard approach or conventions to follow, so I was interested to learn more.
Do you work on an android app that&amp;#39;s split up into modules? If so, it would great if you could spend a few mins filling out this survey, gathering data on your approach - I&amp;#39;ll publish the results so everyone in Android community can benefit!</description>

      <title>Tracking Android app metrics</title>

      <description>When I joined Monzo I was keen to keep a track of metrics that would help us keep a handle on the app&amp;rsquo;s size and method count. I set up a shell script on our CI to upload the numbers to StatHat each time we merged a change to our develop branch. This was great in theory, but not visible enough to be actually useful - in fact, one of the stats stopped uploading properly some months ago and we didn&amp;rsquo;t even notice.</description>

      <title>Dynamically changing SVG colours on Android</title>

      <description>Recently, I needed to change the colour of part of a drawable - and I wanted to do it better than manually swapping out the whole image, or swapping in and out the changing part and overlaying this on top of a base image.
I knew I wanted the assets to be vector based if at all possible - SVG support was added in Lollipop with the VectorDrawable class and have been a great addition.</description>

      <title>Death to Ugly Android Screenshots</title>
      <link>https://www.emmav.me/posts/2015-oct-11-clean-status-bar/</link>

      <description>Clean Status Bar is an app I created in September 2014 to try and make taking nice screenshots for the Google Play Store easy and fast. Ugly screenshots are a distraction from the app you&amp;rsquo;re trying to show off, and have become somewhat of a pet peeve of mine. When I&amp;rsquo;m looking at an app on the Play Store and wondering whether it&amp;rsquo;s worth downloading or not, the first thing I look at is the screenshots.</description>
