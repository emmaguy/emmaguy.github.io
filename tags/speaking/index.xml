      <description>[Upcoming] Beyond &amp;lsquo;Senior Engineer&amp;rsquo; Talk at Women of Silicon Roundabout on 7th December 2020
Often, progression in an engineering role means moving into line managing people. However, this is not for everyone nor is it the only available option. In this talk we&amp;rsquo;ll look at several choices for progression, and explore what the day to day of each of those looks like.
We&amp;rsquo;ll also discuss the hurdles and challenges that you may face in undertaking this personal growth, such as dealing with imposter syndrome or measuring your impact now that you&amp;rsquo;re not writing so much code.</description>
